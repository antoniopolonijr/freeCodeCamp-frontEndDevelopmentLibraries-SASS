/* The last challenge showed how the @for directive uses a starting and ending value to loop a certain number of times. Sass also offers the @each directive which loops over each item in a list or map. On each iteration, the variable gets assigned to the current value from the list or map.

Write an @each directive that goes through a list: blue, black, red and assigns each variable to a .color-bg class, where the color part changes for each item to the respective color. Each class should set the background-color to the respective color as well. */
