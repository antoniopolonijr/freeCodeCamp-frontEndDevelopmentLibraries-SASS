/* The @while directive is an option with similar functionality to the JavaScript while loop. It creates CSS rules until a condition is met.

The @for challenge gave an example to create a simple grid system. This can also work with @while.

Use @while to create a series of classes with different font-sizes.

There should be 5 different classes from text-1 to text-5. Then set font-size to 15px multiplied by the current index number. Make sure to avoid an infinite loop! */

$x: 1;
@while $x <= 5 {
  .text-#{$x} {
    font-size: 15px * $x;
  }
  $x: $x + 1;
}
